Pesticides are highly persistent in the environment and are readily stored and concentrated in poultry and livestock tissues and therefore represent a concern for human health. The dangerous nature of these industrial chemicals requires constant vigilance at all levels, from the corporate arena to federal, state, and local governments. EPA has established tolerances for these chemicals and the FDA and USDA have the responsibility to enforce them, but our customers bear the burden of compliance to ensure a safe product. The potential economic consequences of contamination, if left undetected, can readily exceed $1 million. Diversified Laboratories makes it as easy and convenient for our customers to ensure safe products for themselves and their customers with quick, accurate, and confidential testing.
